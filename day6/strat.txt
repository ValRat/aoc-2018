# Strat: Make a n x m matrix using largest coordinatet
# values. Then do n*m*k comparisons to all k coordinates
# and populate each element of matrix with the closest coordinate
# eliminate all c coordinates which are 'edge' coordinates
# i.e. having index of 0, n, m. Thus remaining coordinatets of k - c
# can be iterated on the matrix to see which one has the highest
# number of assigned elements
