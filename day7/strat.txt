Graph as a list:
If we represent this as a directed dependency graph,
and take an INVERSE of this graph we find that all
elements with NO edges and NOT in the EXECUTED set
will be the next in line to be executed. 


Graph as a matrix:
Don't have to inverse since it's cheaper to look down
a column to find vertices with no edges associated with
it and check against the EXECUTED set.
